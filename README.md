# Visual Comparison of Foundational Generative AI Models

This is a comprehensive visualization and comparison of foundational Deep Generative AI models. The Author believes that the process of "comparison" is perhaps the root of all scientific curiosity. Hence, this project serves an educational and a research purpose to simplify our understanding of complex scientific concepts through an easy-to-use visualization.

Fun Fact:

For every AI model, author has provided analogy to a cooking scenario in real life, which correlates with what the AI is actually doing!
